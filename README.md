# Portfolio-Optimization-Efficient-Frontier-and-Forecasted-Portfolio-Turnover-
Portfolio optimization is the process of selecting the best portfolio (asset distribution), out of the set of all portfolios being considered, according to some objective. The objective typically maximizes factors such as expected return, and minimizes costs like financial risk.

**global minimum variance portfolio (GMVP)**:
The global minimum variance portfolio (GMVP) allocates a given budget among n financial assets such that the risk for the rate of expected portfolio return is minimized.

**Maximum Sharpe Portfolio or Tangency Portfolio**:
Maximum Sharpe Portfolio or Tangency Portfolio is a portfolio on the efficient frontier at the point where line drawn from the point (0, risk-free rate) is tangent to the efficient frontier.

**Portfolio turnover**:
Portfolio turnover is a measure of how quickly securities in a fund are either bought or sold by the fund's managers, over a given period of time. The rate of turnover is important for potential investors to consider, as funds that have a high rate will also have higher fees to reflect the turnover costs.

Formula of Portfolio turnover:
      Portfolio Turnover = (Net sales / Average asset under management)
